<p align="center">Welcome to my smart construction site project! This project is designed to help construction site managers monitor the number of workers and vehicles on their site in real-time using computer vision techniques.</p>

<h3 align="center">Project Overview 🕵️‍♂️ </h3>
<p>This project utilizes object detection and counting techniques to detect and count the number of workers and vehicles on the construction site. The object detection is performed using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, and the object counting is done using OpenCV. The live video stream is captured using a camera placed on the construction site.</p>

<h2 align="center">Getting Started 🤹‍♀️</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following Python modules:-</p>
- OpenCV <br>
- NumPy <br>  
<p> You can install these modules using pip by running the following command:-</p>
<code> pip install opencv-python numpy </code> <br>
<p>Once you have installed these modules, you can clone the repository and run the <code> site.py </code>  file to start the object detection and counting process.</p>

<h3 align="center">Usage 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️</h3>
<p>To use the smart construction site tool, simply run the <code> site.py </code> file. The tool will capture the live video stream from the camera placed on the construction site and detect and count the number of workers and vehicles on the site. The tool will display the total count of workers and vehicles on the site in real-time.</p>
